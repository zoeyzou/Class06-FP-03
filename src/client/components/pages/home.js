      <h3>HackYourFuture</h3>
      <p>
        HackYourFuture is an educational program that aims to train refugees and
        asylum seekers to become web-developers and empower them by opening the
        doors to a very in-demand job market.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our free 6-month program we train refugees, asylum seekers and people
        with limited access to further education in modern JavaScript software
        development. Our aim is to have our students land their first software
        development job after finishing our course. We achieve this by not only
        teaching them relevant frameworks, but also by preparing them for a job
        market that requires independent problem solving and continuous
        self-development. After completion of our program we guide students
        towards work via our network. With our team of experienced professional
        developers we have created a curriculum around the needs of non-western
        students. Our teachers are all volunteers and extremely passionate about
        coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe talented refugees are a great opportunity for society and we
        are here to give them a helping hand to make use of their potential.
